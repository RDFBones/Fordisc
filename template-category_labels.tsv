fordisc:IncompleteRampartOnVentralPubicSymphysealMargin	Rampart incomplete				3. Rampart incomplete: The ventral rampart, following McKern and Stewart (1957), refers to a distinct outgrowth of bone that ultimately forms the ventral aspect of the symphyseal face. The rampart extends from one or both ends of the symphysis, and it often resembles a roll of well-chewed gum stuck on the ventral edge of the symphyseal face. The rampart does not extend along the entire ventral edge, and often some elements of a youthful symphyseal surface can be followed uninterrupted to the ventral edge of the symphysis. In the superior part of the ventral margin, the rampart forms on the Beveled surface. In the inferior part of the margin, remnants of the original irregular surface can often be seen dipping below a partially formed rampart, which looks as if it was lying on a shallowly furrowed surface. An incomplete rampart frequently extends inferiorly from the bony protuberance defining the cranial end of the face, sometimes forming a bony elevation that resembles a comma, with the rampart being the tail. A rampart can also extend superiorly from the inferior end of the symphysis. Bony extensions from the superior and inferior ends of the symphysis, if both are present, typically leave a gap in the middle one-third of the ventral margin. An early Rampart Incomplete stage can consist of one or more bony knobs, commonly located in the middle one-third of the ventral margin. The knobs can occur with, or without, the formation of a bony rampart extending from the superior and inferior ends of the symphysis. If the rampart is more than two-thirds complete but there is a gap in the superior part of it, you should consider the possibility that the specimen is in the Rampart Complete I or II stages. Occasionally a rampart never completely forms along the ventral margin.	Milner, George R. & Boldsen, Jesper L. (2013). Transition Analysis Age Estimation: Skeletal Scoring Manual.

fordisc:RampartWithSulcusOnVentralPubicSymphysealMargin	Rampart complete with anterior sulcus				4. Rampart complete with anterior sulcus: Here the ventral rampart is complete, but there is a shallow sulcus extending along much of the length of the ventral pubis immediately lateral to the symphysis (often more pronounced inferiorly). The groove is a residual feature related to rampart formation along the ventral margin. A reasonably flat symphyseal surface extends uninterrupted from the dorsal to ventral margins, so the face is unlike the somewhat furrowed appearance of many Rampart Incomplete specimens where there is a shallow groove just dorsal to an incomplete ventral rampart. Occasionally a gap exists in the ventral margin, usually in its superior half; the ventral rampart is otherwise completely formed. This stage is only occasionally found in most skeletal samples that have been examined. Typically the completed rampart is a Stage 5, Rampart Complete Without Sulcus. The only difference between Stages 4 and 5 is the presence of the anterior sulcus in Stage 4.	Milner, George R. & Boldsen, Jesper L. (2013).
